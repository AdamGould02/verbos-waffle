These two neighborhoods both only had 2 reported crimes in the past 30 days. Esplen was also in a tie for 3rd with 4 other neighborhoods, so there could have been a bunch of different outcomes depending on what the data said for my partners.\n",

Esplen was 9th in terms of the number of potholes with 110, but still had significantly less than some other neighborhoods. In terms of those that performed better, there were only 6 with under 100 potholes, showing how close the numbers were.\n",

After being changed to coordinates and then mapped, Esplen, West End, Troy Hill, Larimer, and Lower Laurenceville were the neighborhoods in Pittsburgh with only one facility. The outcome of which neighborhood was best would then be determined by my partners data and what they had found, and if it correlated with my data."
